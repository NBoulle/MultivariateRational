# MultivariateRational

Code to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper [``Multivariate rational approximation of functions with curves of singularities''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13202) by [Nicolas Boull√©](https://github.com/NBoulle), [Astrid Herremans](https://github.com/aherremans), and [Daan Huybrechs](https://github.com/daanhb).

It requires the Chebfun software package in the MATLAB path, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun.

The example file piecewise_diagonal.m requires in addition the UltraSEM package (https://github.com/danfortunato/ultraSEM).
